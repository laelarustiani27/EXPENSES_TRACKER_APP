# 💸 Expense Tracker Application

This advanced Flutter project allows users to efficiently manage their incomes and expenses through a modern interface. The application adopts modern mobile development practices such as state management with **Provider**, data persistence with a **local database**, and a clean code architecture.

You can analyze your financial situation with category-based pie charts, easily record your incomes and expenses, and store all your data securely on your device.

## ✨ Advanced Features

- ✅ **Data Persistence:** All income and expense records are securely stored in the local device database, even when the app is closed.
